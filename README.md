# Flex-Dashboard
Dashboard was created using the R package, Flexdashboard. The dashboard is interactive and measure inputs are reactive to whichever input is selected for the goal input.
Once a measure is selected, the plot, team lead, activity type, and target number will adjust to the desired measure.

Flexdashboard is an extraordinary tool for businesses and government agencies that can't afford other reporting software like Tableau or Power BI.
